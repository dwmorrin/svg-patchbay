# SVG Patchbay

Creates an interactive map a phone-plug style patchbay.
Patch points can be clicked to draw patch cables to describe example patches.
Panning and zooming is similar to map applications:

- double-click zooms in
- right-double-click zooms out
- mouse wheel zooms
- pan and zoom buttons in lower right corner
- mini-map in lower left corner

# API

See the example directory for now; detailed documentation is on the to-do list.
